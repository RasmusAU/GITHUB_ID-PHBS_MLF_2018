## Brief description of data:
* Consists of 5043 movies and 28 features (5043x28 matrix).
* Data is on IMDb movie ratings contraining features on e.g. director, duration, gross earnings, genres, actors, language, budget, IMDb score etc. (see [data](data) for full list of features).
* Data is pulled from www.kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/kevalm/movie-imdb that is originally scraped from IMDb's homepage.

## Goal of the project:
* The goal of this project is to identify the features needed to predict what makes a good movie, defined as ranking highly on the IMDb score, using various methods of machine learning, e.g. logistic regression, KNN, SVM, random forest, bagging and AdaBoosting, based on the book "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka. Which features are most important to a good IMDb score?
* From the best scoring algorithm one can identify the parameters to make a good scoring movie.
